# TreeDataAnalysis
I developed this R linear regression for my third Macaulay seminar, Science in NYC. The purpose of this analysis was to find a correlation between tree density and sewage overflow. My team and I noticed that there were a lot of menhaden dying in Meadow Lake in Queens, NYC due to sewage overflow. We wanted to see whether increasing tree density around the lake would potentially help solve this problem. Unfortunately, our R analysis results were that we could not find a strong enough correlation between tree density and sewage overflow.
